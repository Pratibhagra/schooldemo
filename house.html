                   <p>Agni House is in Yellow dress, a brightness that is often described as cheerful and warm. The inter house competitions, which were conducted, fostered a healthy spirit of competitions as well as strong sense of unity among the members of the house. In the various events the performance of the house was up to the expected standard and we gave a tough fight to other houses. The year 2015-16 has taught us to accept the moments of success and those of failure with indomitable spirit. Agni House has done exceedingly well in almost all events.</p>
                   <p>So far the house students have brought laurels to this house in the various competitions held in this year</p>
                   <p>The team spirit, confidence and co-operation of the students as well as the house tutors are set to make history at SGI. We hope in the coming years victory will embrace us more than this We thank our Principal Madam for the faith that she has kept in me. Once again a big thank you from the bottom of my heart to all the tutors and students.</p>

                   <p>“A TEAM IS NOT A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WORK TOGETHER. IT IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO TRUST ONE ANOTHER.” Hi everyone…! It is a great pride and privilege for me to write this report on TRISHUL HOUSE as a House Master. Earlier, our House was satisfied with third or fourth position, but now in the academic year 2018-19, it is an amazing journey that we are in the leading position. “With time and patience, the mulberry leaf becomes a silk gown.” It is not at all exaggerating to inform you that this transformation and enormous energy to maintain this position is due to the collective efforts of the House members and the students. All the Trishul House students participated enthusiastically and came out with flying colours through their wonderful results in all the Interhouse competitions conducted in the school. With a great discipline, the students contributed immensely not only in the cultural events, but also in sports to bring laurels to their own House. I take much pleasure to mention some names of our House students, who participated in CBSE Cluster, State and National level sports events. Ayush Wani, Basavaraj Narole, Arin Gandhi, Soundarya Mangave (Athletics). Yash Jagtap, Abhijeet Sangnale (Kabbadi). Samarth Chiniwal (Badminton), Prem Runwal (Horseriding). All these students brought laurels and accolades to the school their spectacular achievements in various sports competitions. Miss Gauri Bagali of Grade 8th participated in many co-curricular competitions like MISS, SGIMUN, KITMUN, HMUN and added glory to the school through her achievements

                <div>
                   <p>PRITHVI HOUSE’s greatest glory is not in falling but in rising every time we fall. Prithvi house is green color which symbolizes “Prosperity and Harmony”. This year came with lot of ideas, challenges and strenuous work. It’s not been easy for prithvians to achieve glory with strong competitors without hard work and support of all the tutors and house master. We only believed in fare game, building team spirit inculcating good values on the field and off the field. The encouragement that the house received made us to put our best efforts on the field. Our football boys’ team made a marvelous opening by being winner in both junior and senior category. Girls team added to the glory by being the runners up. In the aquatholan meet, Disha Parle, Vaishnavi Andhare, Umid Gaikwad, Laxman and Sabil made us proud. In Skating, the skaters Saisharan Patil, Nikita Pabari, Disha Parle, shahid Sheik, Runal Bhosale, Shridhar Mali,Aryan Kalloli, Mehak Bothra gave their best performance. Badminton was a setback for our house but that did not curb our desire to be winners. We moved ahead with positive vibes and became the winners of basketball tournament both in girls and senior boys. Swimming added another feather to the cap .In hockey, the boys team made it by being the winners. In table tennis and tennis we had to be satisfied with runners up position. Our junior cricket team breathes hard and emerged as winner while seniors emerged as runners up. Kabbadi, an indigenous game which was introduced this year made a final impact on the house points by being a winner. Pruthvians achieved tremendous success in the field of sports and also curved a niche in co-cuuricular activities. In coloring and poster making competition our students exhibited their love for color, bagged prizes and received appreciation. They displayed their talents in dance, solo singing, and declamation and brought laurels to the house by being the winners in dance and singing. The unique talent that our students have, helped us to gain popularity among all. Our students keep themselves updated with the latest information and this was proved through quiz competition. Technology has become a part of one’s life. Our students participated in PPT presentation and bagged second position. Each student participated actively in all activities, thus exhibiting teamwork, leadership, strong determination and above all trust and faith in each other. These qualities paved way to success and will help us to climb the ladder of success for many years to come. I wish good luck to all the students and extend my gratitude to all the house tutors for kind support directly and indirectly.</p>
