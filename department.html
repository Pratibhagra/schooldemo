                    <p>Language is the blood of the soul into which thoughts run and out of which they grow. If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart. Without language, one cannot talk to people and understand them; one cannot share their hopes and aspirations, grasp their history, appreciate their poetry or savour their songs. It plays a key role in one's expression, presentation and personality English Language, the window to the world, has become the criterion necessary for a successful career.</p>
                    <p>Here at Sanjay Ghodawat International School, The Faculty of English is dedicated to transmit sophisticated skills in Language and Literature to the students and strives to bring out the best in every student by moulding their character, sharpening their communicative skills and equipping them to face the surfeit of challenges in life. Through periodic tests, group discussions, dramatization and role play the teachers monitor the academic performance of the students</p>                 <p>The enriched and experienced faculty has initiated diverse innovative techniques in teaching and learning of English through Remedial Course, English Language Communication Skills Classes across Phonetics, Grammar and Vocabulary and has also helped organise various literary events and competitions on and off campus. It is a matter of great pride that our students have made their presence felt at international conferences like the Model United Conference and the Horlicks Wiz Kids South Asian Grand Finale.</p>

                    <p>The well stacked library, use PowerPoint presentations and the hard work of a team of highly dedicated and committed faculty have enabled the department to maintain a highly potent standard in English Language and Literature. The members of the faculty strive to keep abreast the latest trends in teaching pedagogy by attending workshops and seminars. The teachers work in unison and their team work is the secret of the success of the department.</p>

Each member of the faculty prepares their own analysis and notes through the wide range of reference books available in our school library before they begin their teaching learning transaction. This facilitates the confidence of the subject teachers and helps them plan out for various activities which would reinforce the subject knowledge in each individual taught.</p>

                    <p>There is a philosophy that says that if something is unobservable -- unobservable in principle -- it is not part of science. If there is no way to falsify or confirm a hypothesis, it belongs to the realm of metaphysical speculation, together with astrology and spiritualism. By that standard, most of the universe has no scientific reality -- it's just a figment of our imaginations." - Leonard Susskind,</p>
                    <p>Physics, a branch of science, helps mankind disclose the mysteries of the world and life. In modern world, this branch of science leads the creative developments in science such as space mission, mystery behind the black hole, god's article, etc.</p>
                    <p>At Sanjay Ghodawat International School, we have a proficient team of teachers in the Faculty of Physics. We always put our best scientific efforts to the enrichment and to the bloom of outstanding skills of the students. Our students displayed their innovating skills in ' finding out electricity from various fruits and vegetables'; in a comparative study - 'the amount of energy produced by various fruits and vegetables' and also in 'water level indicator which helps to indicate the water level of dam ,water tanks, etc' , at a science exhibition held at Nagpur recently.</p>
                    <p>We have a holistic pedagogical dimension across the smart classes, laboratories and PowerPoint presentations, which helps students to comprehend the concepts very easily. The Faculty is taking better steps for inculcating the scientific interest among the learner community.</p>

                    <p>Chemistry is the study of the way materials are put together and their behaviour under varied conditions. This science, more than any other, involves all of one's senses: seeing, hearing, tasting, feeling, and smelling. It is a springboard in to other scientific fields.</p>
                    <p>The history of Chemistry essentially started with the alchemists who tried in vain to transform everything imaginable into gold. All of their efforts to produce gold failed. These so-called "mad chemists" are the forefathers of experimentation. They spent time studying the problem, designed innumerable experiments and unlike other scientists of their days, they actually experimented. Special equipment was not available for them to order through science catalogues. They designed and made all of the needed flasks and beakers. Some of these designs, in modified form, are still used today in our modern chemistry laboratories.</p>
                    <p>These chemists of the past were the first to use what is now described as the scientific method a logical approach to the solution of a problem through experimentation. Even today, just the mention of the word chemistry too often conjures up the image of a "mad scientist" hovering over strange bubbling flasks. Unfortunately, explosions, danger, and flesh-eating acids are associated with chemistry.</p>
                    <p>Even with our vast knowledge of chemistry, there is still so much to be learned and discovered. There are many opportunities in the field of Chemistry for a person with an inquisitive mind and a spirit of adventure. Much is yet to be learned, but great fun and excitement is in store for the beginning scientist in discovering the Chemistry secrets that have already been unlocked.</p>
                    <p>Here we, the Faculty of Chemistry at TPS, encourage our students towards innovating skills and applications in industrial chemistry, bio chemistry and many more across its specialized studies. Our learners are always taught how to learn- an outcome based education.</p>

                    <p>The Faculty of Computer Science is dedicated to train students participate actively in all events happening on and off campus for information sharing, processing of information, PowerPoint presentation, making movies in movie maker, sitting the competitive examinations like NCO, IIO, and taking part in seminars at National and International Levels.</p>
                    <p>We are making our students digitally strong and Technocratic to face the global challenges for the future by teaching them total Ms-office package, programming languages like C,C++ ,VB and Database handling with Ms- access for software development across through training in hardware and networking.</p>

                    <p>Art is a poem without words. Some people say art is life, which is close to the truth. Art imitates life, and inspires life. Art is important to our society and each one of us individually for many reasons. Art throughout time tells our history, our desires, and our fears. It also helps us express ourselves. With one piece of artwork, we can convey many messages without saying a word. It's amazing and endless what we can do, feel, and achieve through our art. Everyone at one point in their lives must have been inspired by some art form, and it will continue to inspire generations to come.</p>
                    <p>Department of Art at Sanjay Ghodawat International School plays a central role in all the activities. Students are trained in different art forms and also in crafts. Art forms: portrait, Landscape, Water colour, head study to draw human figure, etc. are introduced to children, in person. Maximum use of time and facilities are made, as all the state of art materials and equipments are available in art room.</p>
                    <p>The department proved to be most successful in interschool competitions. Our children bought laurels to the school through the competitions held at Horlicks Wizkids Pune, Jayant Carnival, Shahu Carnival, Xest Fest and VIVA.</p>
                    <p>Students are trained to excel in face painting, Rangoli, flower decoration, nail art, drawing, Book mark, tattoo making, Cartoons, etc. There is a long list of Prize winners ... .We congratulate all of them on making the school and also their parents feel proud.</p>
