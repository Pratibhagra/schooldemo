                <div>
                    <p>Home science, or the science of home, includes all the things that concern the person, home, family members and resources. It is the education for "better living" and also the core of education including the family ecosystem which deals with reciprocal relations between the family and its natural man power environments.</p>
                    <p>It gives the person all the knowledge of the scientific procedures involved in making a home beautiful.</p>
                    <p>Sanjay Ghodawat International School has introduced Home Science as a Hobby Club. Home Science education tries to train and educate one to make a perfect interface between these two spheres of women's life. People say cooking is an art, and that's true, but the science of cooking is easier to grasp and repeat. Understanding it will make the students a better cook in future among to full fill the satisfaction of the entire living organism. In Home Science Club the students regularly participate in making delicious items such as milkmaid cake, fruit custard, Onion Bhajji, Puri Bhaji, Vermicelli Kheer,Gulab Jamun, Aaloo Paratha and Poha.Students enjoy a lot while making the snacks in a short period. They learn many recipes to prepare. Sincere thanks to Mess department who helped in arranging Utensils and helping our students to participate in outside competitions.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>TPS always provides enormous opportunities to the students to explore their hidden talents in theatre. Students really give awesome performance whenever required be it a class assembly, house assembly or special assembly. Recently the student dramatists of TPS have made us proud by showing their extreme and fantabulous dramatic talent on various stages. To name a few a street play based on Anti- Toll. All these performances have secured positions in various competitions like Xest Fest, Kolhapur, Jayant Carnival, Islampur and Viva Carnival respectively.</p>
                    <p>At TPS we strive to enhance the creative talents in each and every child. And upto a certain extent the students of drama club are successful in imparting those values. We hope that this journey would continue further adding more and more golden feathers for the glory of TPS
                        .

                    <p>"You are never alone when you are reading a book". We, the TPS'ns began with a club called BOOK REVIEW. It is our intention to open the vistas of knowledge for students. Our objectives are.....</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To develop interest among the students to read books and critically examine.</li>
                        <li>To make children select a work or story book of their own interest.</li>
                        <li>Teach students to think critically about read story by raising doubts like - Why, When, Where and How.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Students had keen interest in it. They loved to read the books of their interest. Variety of books were read during the Hobby Club like</p>

                    <p>"I Wish more people felt that photography was an adventure the same as life itself and felt that their individual feelings were worth expressing, To me, that makes photography more exciting." Harry Callahan</p>
                    <p>Callahan Photography is a part of the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the globe. The widespread availability and ease of owning a camera is a product of the digital age and we all so fortunate for it. Whether you have a simple point and shoot to capture family moments and day to day ramblings or a multi- thousand dollar medium format with a digital back for large production advertising, photography touches all of us.</p>
                    <p>Photography club was started in the school this academic year and our presence is felt everywhere as we were always ready with our cameras to capture the best of the moments of TPS and even outside the school. There are thirty five active members in the photography club. Every Saturday we come with new ideas and experiment different photography styles and gain technical knowledge about the cameras.</p>
                    <p>We have conducted sessions on nature photography, water drop photography, capturing events, portraits, Mansoon photography, etc. A session on Handling SLR Camera was conducted with a professional photographer.</p>
                    <p>A camera allows us to preserve memories far past when they might have slipped our mind. It helps us to pass those memories into the hands of future generations. Our photos are little legacies of the life we have led. We have an array of plans for the next season.....</p>

                <div>
                    <p>We all are a part of the environment. Many environmental problems can be solved by changing our view point towards the environment. Let's keep our area clean and conserve the natural resources by reusing things. This cannot be changed overnight in the country with a population of more than 100 crore. But changes can be made in the social behavior by the children. There is no selfishness in the children and new thoughts can easily be imbibed by the children. They are our future. Every child can create important effect in his own surrounding.</p>
                    <p>The club consists of twenty student members, three teachers and a gardener. We meet once a week for one and half hours to work on the objectives with which the club has designed. We also plan things for the next week and do the necessary preparations.</p>
                    <p>Students learned to prepare the land for growing plants. They also learn to identify the weeds and remove them as these weeds destroy the existing plants. The students sowed potatoes, onions, garlic, ginger, turmeric, coriander, fenugreek, carrots, mustard and carom. They were informed about the quantity of water required at different stages of growth. The students were very excited at every step. Their joy knew no bounds when they harvested all the above mentioned plants.</p>
                    <p>We have also planted Hibiscus, Vinca Rosea, Asters, Arum, Tulsi, Curry leaves. Children take pleasure in taking care of these plants and nurturing them. These activities actually helped the students in identifying the biodegradable waste from the non -biodegradable. They also learnt the art of best out of waste using the non-biodegradable waste.</p>
                    <p>Growing strawberry plants, a field trip for students, to give botanical and common names of the trees growing in our school and composting are en the anvil which will be done in the days to come. Our continual effort is to urge children to save and conserve trees for a greener earth.</p>

                    <p>As our school gives chance to grow different individual abilities dormant in students ,we electrical club members also got chance to create and develop the knowledge of electrical energy and its significance in the modern world and also we could give a picture of development of science and its importance .we have 40 members in electrical club .the entre students made in to different groups to conduct the activities very easily and smoothly .we have special periods for hobby club that is on every Saturday last three periods.</p>
                    <p>In hobby club we could give proper inspiration for the creative development of students .we have explained electrical circuits ,its various components and its functions. we have made and shown the working of FM-radio and its importance parts ,we made water level indicator ,hydroelectric power project from plastics and metal pieces ,agro- field water level indicator.</p>
                    <p>In nutshell we could give a chance to give interest towards the modern scientific field and also we advised them the significance of science in the present world.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>When thinking brings the ideas into actions there begins productive outcome .....</p>
                    <p>TPS, a right place to shape the child to face the 21 st century challenges. This year we decided to begin with 'ROBOTICS CLUB 'to emulate 100% genius of the child utilizing the resources available. We have collaboration with 'THINKLABS TECHNOSOLUTIONS PVT. LTD. ,MUMBAI'. Before we begin Robotics Club seven of our teachers from Maths and Science Department underwent training session for seven days</p>
                    <p>Teaching robotics to young minds is a very good introduction into Science and Technology. Not only do they learn to design and construct a robot, but also they get a more complete idea what is required for an organism to act that they can test their skills in games like Dance, Rescue and Soccer in the real world How do we do it ?</p>
                    <p>Robotics mixes the creativity and curiosity of young students with the hands-on education aspects of Science and Technology. With focus on Robot building and Science based activities, our learning methodology takes up innovative and challenging ideas and converts them into solutions in the form of working robots.</p>
                    <p>Highlights of our pedagogy :</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Develops scientific temperament and strengthens curricular concepts.</li>
                        <li>Nurtures creativity and innovation</li>
                        <li>Develops logical and analytical thinking</li>
